# Butterfly-esti
A website I created for my wife's esthetician business.
The purpose of the website is display my current knowledge as of 20FEB2023 during the Odin Project on HTML and CSS.
This project was initially created on Replit so I can see changes as I made them, and then I recoded it to look cleaner on VS code. From there, I used my skills with GitHub to add, commit and push my code onto GitHub
